# Frozen-Lake-v1-Reinforcement-Learning
The goal of the project was to find the most optimal policy for the froze lake-v1 environment using policy iteration, bellman optimality equation and perform value iteration.
Here are the steps that I have followed:
      1. Import Libraries.
      2. initializing the environment and setting is_slipper= False
      3.Perform policy evaluation iterations until the smallest change is less than smallest_change.
      4.perform policy improvement using the Bellman optimality equation.
      5.Find the most optimal policy for the FrozenLake-v1 environment using policy iteration.
      6.Perform a test pass on the FrozenLake-v1 environment.
      7.take steps through the FrozenLake-v1 environment randomly.
      8.Perform value iteration to find the most optimal policy for the FrozenLake-v1 environment.
